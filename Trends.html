            <h2>Tiny PCs</h2>
            <p>Computers have shrunk again. Forget tiny notebooks or even media tablets if you want portability—today’s newest tiny PCs are the size of a USB flash drive.</p>
            <p>Some of these new computers actually do look just like a USB flash drive; others are just a small circuit board, sometimes enclosed in a case. Whatever their appearance, the idea is similar—you connect them to a display device and an input device (if needed) and you are good to go.</p>
            <p>These emerging tiny PCs are designed to connect in different ways and have different capabilities. For example, Google’s Chromecast (shown in the accompanying photo) plugs directly into an HDTV using its built-in HDMI connector. After connecting Chromecast, you can stream online content (such as videos, movies, and music) via Wi-Fi from your smartphone, tablet, or laptop to that HDTV. The Raspberry Pi tiny PC can connect to an HDTV via HDMI, as well as to a standard TV via RCA jacks. Instead of being used in conjunction with another device like Chromecast, however, the Raspberry Pi is a stand-alone computer that can be used with USB input devices (such as a keyboard and mouse) and connects to the Internet via an Ethernet port. Another tiny stand-alone PC is the Cstick Cotton Candy. This device, the size of a USB flash drive, can connect to another computer or an HDTV via its built-in HDMI and USB ports, to peripheral devices via USB or Bluetooth, and to the Internet via Wi-Fi.</p>
            <p>The flexibility of these devices and the apps that can be used with them vary from device to device, based on the operating system used (most use a version of Linux or Android, though Chromecast uses Chrome) and the amount of storage available (devices with a USB port typically support USB flash drives or hard drives for additional storage if needed). But for turning a TV at any location into your own personal computer, gaming device, or video player, tiny PCs are definitely the way to go.</p>

            <h2>Virtualization</h2>
            <p>Virtualization, such as creating separate virtual environments on a single server that act as separate servers or delivering each user's desktop to his or her device.</p>

            <h2>Restaurant iPad Ordering Systems</h2>
            <p>This new trend of using iPads and e-menus to have customers place their orders in restaurants is growing rapidly. In addition to enabling customers to place their orders at their convenience without waiting for a server, it also allows the restaurant to provide more resources to customers (such as photographs of menu items, pairing suggestions for appetizers and drinks, and so forth). The overall goal is to allow customers to control their dining experience from the time they are seated until they choose to pay the check. And, yes, they pay via the iPad as well (see the credit card reader at the top right of the iPad shown in the accompanying photo). iPad ordering systems work especially</p>
